# aircraft-fairing-redesign

Objective:
Redesign a lightweight, modular fairing for an aircraft flap track using Fusion 360.

Tools Used:
- Fusion 360 (CAD modelling and simulation)
- FEA Simulation (basic load testing)
- Google Docs (design log + report)

Project Files:
- CAD exports (.stl)
- PDF design report
- Images of iterations and final concept

Key Learnings:
- Stress-focused design changes
- Material comparison (Aluminium vs composite)
- CAD workflow documentation

This project was completed as a self-directed summer challenge while studying Aerospace Engineering at Nottingham Trent University.
